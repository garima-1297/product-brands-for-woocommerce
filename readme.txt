This plugin allows you to add brands for products in your shop.

== Description ==

Showing well-known brands in your store offers several benefits for both you and your customers, particularly in an online shop where quality cannot be "felt," and a product's value can quickly be undervalued or overstated.

The Product Brands Addon for the WooCommerce plugin is a great way to organize your site, showcase your brands, and serve as a filter for your consumers while they're doing UX research. It improves the description and display of the product on the e-commerce site.

Aside from the desire to keep prices high and other benefits that we can't describe here, the Product Brands Addon for WooCommerce plugin now allows you to add this easy but powerful feature to your store.
